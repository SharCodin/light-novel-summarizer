Only Hephaistos Familia decided to stay on the sidelines in order to preserve their position as a metalsmith familia. They would set out on the expedition in ten days. Aisha had asked Bell and the others if they would take Antianeira with them on an expedition.\n",

But now, since the party is so strong, they've ended up aiming for the lower levels of the Dungeon instead of tackling the middle levels. Daphne drew a dagger that resembled a conductor's baton from the sword belt at her waist and swung it through the air. Good leadership can still really save a party. They say adventurers live or die depending on who's in the rear guard.\n",
